# Austin Blain

*Ahoy*! My name is **Austin**. I love creating applications that solve problems and make people's lives better.

I work at [Mocaworks](https://mocaworks.com/), as the **Lead Front End Engineer** (or "`Developer`", if you're bothered by the term "`Software Engineer`"). There are various aspects of my role, but some that stick out are:

- Maintaining and Devloping a longstanding **B2B SaaS** (well over a decade old)
- Wrangling Webpack
- Creating new SaaS applications (maintainably/conscientiously)
- Making Technical Decisions pertaining to how the above 3 play out
- Helping other Front End Devs grows in their abilities, and making sure they feel both empowered in their roles

## Tech I particularly enjoy using:

- JavaScript
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (I like it a lot...)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (*especially* when paired with TypeScript ðŸ‘Œ)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [GO](https://go.dev/)
